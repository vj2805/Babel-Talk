# BABEL-TALK

A bidirectional voice translator app is a software application that allows users to translate spoken language from one language to another in real-time, 
facilitating communication between speakers of different languages. Unlike traditional text-based translation tools, 
a bidirectional voice translator app processes spoken language input and produces spoken language output, enabling seamless conversation between users who speak different languages.

## Installation

To use this app, you need to install the following dependencies:

- [Pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/): A text-to-speech conversion library in Python.
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/): Library for performing speech recognition with support for various engines and APIs.
- [flet](https://pypi.org/project/flet/): (Please provide a brief description of what flet does if it's not a well-known library)
- [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/): Provides Python bindings for PortAudio, the cross-platform audio I/O library.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition flet PyAudio
